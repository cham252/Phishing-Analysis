# Phishing Analysis 


---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project helps you set up a self-contained enterprise-style network environment using VirtualBox or VMware, featuring realistic hosts, attacker VMs, and defense tools. Simulate phishing, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and incident response.

## Phishing Email Detection:

- Understanding the anatomy of a phishing email, including key indicators such as suspicious links, spoofed sender addresses, and urgent language.
- Analyzing email headers to identify source IPs and verify sender authenticity.
- Recognizing red flags like poor grammar, unexpected attachments, and unusual sender domains.
  
## Email Forensics:

- Investigating email headers to trace the origin of the phishing attempt.
- Understanding how to identify malicious URLs and attachments within phishing emails.

## Threat Intelligence:

- Researching threat actors and phishing campaigns based on identified phishing indicators.
- Correlating phishing attempts with known attack patterns and campaigns (such as spear phishing or business email compromise).
- Using external threat intelligence sources to enrich your analysis.
